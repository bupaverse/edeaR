The filters for event data subsetting can mostly be divided into two type: event filters and case filters. Event filters will subset _parts_ of cases based on criteria applied on the events (e.g. the resource which performed it), while case filters will subset complete cases, based on criteria applied on the cases (e.g. the trace length). 

Each filter has a _reverse_ argument, which allows to reverse the filter very easily. Furthermore, each filter has an interface-alternative, which can be called by adding a _i_ before the function name. 

## Event filters

### Filter activities

The filter activity function can be used to filter activities by name. It has three arguments

*	the event log
*	a vector of activities
*	the reverse argument (FALSE or TRUE)

```{r}
patients %>%
	filter_activity(c("X-Ray", "Blood test")) %>%
	summary
```

As one can see, there are only 2 distinct activities left in the event log.

### Filter on activity frequency

It is also possible to filter on activity frequency. This filter uses a percentile cut off, and will look at those activities which are most frequent until the required percentage of events has been reached. Thus, a percentile cut off of 80% will look at the activities needed to represent 80% of the events. In the example below, the __least__ frequent activities covering 50% of the event log are selected, since the reverse argument is true.

```{r}
patients %>%
	filter_activity_frequency(percentage = 0.5, reverse = T) %>%
	activity_frequency("activity")

	
```

### Filter on attributes

The filter_attributes function is a very generic function an can be supplied with conditions on the data set, in the same way as the `dplyr::filter` function. As such, it allows you to filter on event or case attributes. Multiple conditions can be listed, separated by a comma. In that case, the comma will be treated as "and". You can use the |-symbol to state "OR". Since the patients dataset does not have many additional attributes, the example below uses the resource and activity. This filter is thus the same as the combination of filter_activity and filter_resource, in case both conditions were required. However, it has the advantange of stating both conditions as OR.

```{r}
patients %>% 
	filter_attributes(employee == "r1" | handling == "X-Ray") 
```


### Filter resources

Similar to the activity filter, the resource filter can be used to filter events by listing on or more resources. 

```{r}
patients %>%
	filter_resource(c("r1","r4")) %>%
	resource_frequency("resource")
```


### Trim cases

The trim filter is a special event filter, as it also take into account the notion of cases. In fact, it _trim_ cases such that they start with a certain activities until they end with a certain activity. It requires two list: one for possible start activities and one for end activities. The cases will be trimmed from the first appearance of a start activity till the last appearance of an end activity. When reversed, these _slices_ of the event log will be removed instead of preserved.

```{r}
patients %>%
	filter_trim(start_activities = "Registration", end_activities =  c("MRI SCAN","X-Ray")) %>%
	traces()
```

## Case filters


#### Filter activity presence

This functions allows to filter cases that contain certain activities. It requires as input a vector containing one or more activity labels and it has a `method` argument. The latter can have the values _all_, _none_ or _one_of_. When set to _all_, it means that all the specified activity labels must be present for a case to be selected, _none_ means that they are not allowed to be present, and _one_of_ means that at least one of them must be present. 


#### Filter case

The case filter allows to subset a set of case identifiers. As arguments it only requires a vector of case id's. The selection can also be negated using  `reverse = T`. 

#### Filter end points

The `filter_endpoints` method filters cases based on the first and last activity label. It can be used in two ways: by specifying vectors with allowed start activities and/or allowed end activities, or by specifying a percentile. In the latter case, the percentile value will be used as a cut off. For example, when set to 0.9, it will select the most common endpoint pairs which together cover at least 90% of the cases, and filter the event log accordingly. This filter can also be reversed.

#### Filter precedence

In order to extract a subset of an event log which conforms with a set of precedence rules, one can use the `filter_precedence` method. There are two types of precendence relations which can be tested: activities that should _directly follow_ each other, or activities that should _eventually follow_ each other. The type can be set with the _precedence_type_ argument. Further, the filter requires a vector of one or more antecedents (containing activity labels), and one or more consequents. Finally, also a _filter_method_ argument can be set. This argument is relevant when there is more than one antecedent or consequent. In such a case, you can specify that all possible precedence combinations must be present (_all_), or at least one of them (_one_of).


#### Filter processing time, throughput time and trace length

There are three different filters which take into account the _length_ of a case:

*  processing time: which is the sum of the duration of the activity instances contained in the case.
*  throughput time: which is the time between the first event and the last event of the case.
*  trace length: which is the number of activity instances contained in the case.

Each of these filters can work in two ways, similar to the endpoints filter: either by using an interval or by using a percentile cut off. The percentile cut off will always start with the shortest cases first and stop including cases when the specified percentile is reached. The processing and throughput time filters also have a _units_ attribute to specify the time unit used when defining an interval. All the methods can be reversed by setting `reverse = T`.

#### Filter time period

Cases can also be filtered by supplying a time window to the method `filter_time_period`. There are four different filter methods, of which one can be used as argument:

*	contained: retains all cases which are completely contained in the time period.
*	start: retains the cases which started in the time period, regardless of their end point.
*	complete: retains the cases which were completed in the time period, regardless of their starting point.
*	intersecting: retains the cases which have at least one event within the time period.

The selection can also be reversed. Note that there is a 5\textsuperscript{th} filter method, _trim_, but this is actually an event filter and will thus be discussed in the next section.

#### Filter trace frequency

The last case filter can be used to filter cases based on the frequency of the corresponding trace. A trace is a sequence of activity labels, and will be discussed in more detail in Section \ref{mining-and-analysis-1}. There are again two ways to select cases based on trace frequency, by interval or by percentile cut off. The percentile cut off will start with the most frequent traces. This filter also contains the reverse argument.
