\item{eventlog}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}}; please use \code{log} instead.}

\item{type}{The type of repetitions, either repeat or redo.}

\item{level}{Level of granularity for the analysis: log,  case, activity, resource or resource-activity.
For more information, see \code{vignette("metrics", "edeaR")}}

\item{append}{\code{\link{logical}} (default \code{TRUE}): Indicating whether to append results to original log. Ignored when level is \code{log} or \code{trace}.}

\item{append_column}{Which of the output columns to append to log, if \code{append = TRUE}. Default column depends on chosen level.}

\item{sort}{\code{\link{logical}} (default \code{TRUE}): Sort output on count. Only for levels with frequency count output.}

\description{
Provides information statistics on the number of repetitions
}
\details{
A repetition is an execution
of an activity within a case while that activity has already been executed before, but
one or more other activities are executed in between.Similar to the self-loop metric, a distinction
should be made between repeat and redo repetitions.
Repeat repetitions are activity executions of the same activity type that are executed
not immediately following each other, but by the same resource. Redo repetitions
are activity executions of the same activity type that are executed not immediately
following each other and by a different resource than the first activity occurrence of
this activity type.

\itemize{

\item The number of repetitions can be calculated on the level of the complete event log. This metric shows the
summary statistics of the number of repetitions within a case, which can provide
insights in the amount of waste in an event log. Each combination of two or more
occurrences of the same activity, executed not immediately following each other,
by the same resource is counted as one repeat repetition of this activity.

\item On case level, this metric provides the absolute and relative number of repetitions in each case.

\item On the level of specific activities, this metric shows which activities occur the most in a repetition.
The absolute and relative number of both repeat and redo repetitions is
provided by this metric, giving an overview per activity.

\item When looking at the different resources executing activities in the event log, it can be interesting to have an overview
of which resources need more than one time to execute an activity in a case or
which resources need to have an activity redone later on in the case by another
resource. This metric provides the absolute and relative number of times each
resource appears in a repetition.

\item Finally, the same metric can be
looked at on the level of specific resource-activity combinations, providing the
company with specific information about which activities and which resources
are involved in the repetitions. For this metric the absolute and relative number
of repeat and redo repetitions is provided. Again two difierent relative numbers
are provided, one relative to the total number of executions of the activity in the
complete event log, and one relative to the total number of executions performed
by the resource throughout the complete event log.
