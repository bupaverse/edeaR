\usage{
filter_activity_instance(eventlog, activity_instances = NULL, reverse = FALSE)

ifilter_activity_instance(eventlog)
}
\arguments{
\item{eventlog}{The dataset to be used. Should be a (grouped) eventlog object.}

\item{activity_instances}{A vector of activity instance identifiers}

\item{reverse}{Logical, indicating whether the selection should be reversed.}
}
\value{
When given an eventlog, it will return a filtered eventlog. When given a grouped eventlog, the filter will be applied
in a stratified way (i.e. each separately for each group). The returned eventlog will be grouped on the same variables as
the original event log.
}
\description{
Filters the log based on activity instance identifier
}
\details{
The method filter_activity_instance can be used to filter on activity instance identifiers. It has an activity_instances argument,
to which a vector of identifiers can be given. The selection can be negated with the reverse argument.
