\title{Metric: Activity Frequency}
\usage{
activity_frequency(
  eventlog,
  level = c("log", "trace", "activity", "case"),
  append = F,
  append_column = NULL,
  sort = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{eventlog}{The dataset to be used. Should be a (grouped) eventlog object.
\code{eventlog}.}

\item{level}{Level of granularity for the analysis: log, trace, case, activity. For more information, see \code{vignette("metrics", "edeaR")}}

\item{append}{Logical, indicating whether to append results to original event log. Ignored when level is log or trace.}

\item{append_column}{Which of the output columns to append to log, if append = T. Default column depends on chosen level.}

\item{sort}{Sort output on count. Defaults to TRUE. Only for levels with frequency count output.}

\item{...}{Deprecated arguments}
}
\description{
Provides summary statistics about the frequency of activity types at the level of log, traces, cases, activity types.
}
\details{
\itemize{ \item At log level, This metric shows the summary statistics of the frequency of activities throughout the complete event log.
\item  On the level of the cases, this metric showsthe absolute and relative number of times the different activity types occur in
each case. The absolute number shows the number of distinct activity types
that occur in each of the cases. The relative number is calculated based on the total activity executions in the case. \item On trace level, this metric
presents the absolute and relative number of times a specific activity type occurs in each trace. \item On the level of the activities, this metric
provides the absolute and relative frequency of a specific activity in the complete event log.
