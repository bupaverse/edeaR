\arguments{
\item{eventlog}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}}; please use \code{log} instead.}

\item{level}{Level of granularity for the analysis: log,  case, activity, resource or resource-activity.
For more information, see \code{vignette("metrics", "edeaR")}}

\item{append}{\code{\link{logical}} (default \code{TRUE}): Indicating whether to append results to original log. Ignored when level is \code{log} or \code{trace}.}

\item{append_column}{Which of the output columns to append to log, if \code{append = TRUE}. Default column depends on chosen level.}

\item{units}{Time units to be used}

\item{work_schedule}{A schedule of working hours. If provided, only working hours are counted as processing time.}

\item{...}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}} Deprecated arguments}

\item{sort}{Sort by decreasing throughput time. Defaults to true. Only relevant for case level.}
}
\description{
Provides summary statistics concerning the throughput times of cases.
}
\details{
\itemize{

\item The throughput time of a case is the total duration
of the case, or the difference between the timestamp of the end event and the
timestamp of the start event of the case. Possible idle time is also included
in this calculation.
\item On log level, the summary statistics of these throughput to describe the throughput time of cases in an
aggregated fashion.
\item Instead of looking at all cases in the log, it
can be interesting to analyse the different process variants or traces in the log
