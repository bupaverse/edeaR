\arguments{
\item{eventlog}{The dataset to be used. Should be a (grouped) eventlog object.
\code{eventlog}.}

\item{level}{Level of granularity for the analysis: log,  case, trace, or resource.
For more information, see \code{vignette("metrics", "edeaR")}}

\item{append}{Logical, indicating whether to append results to original event log. Ignored when level is log or trace.}

\item{append_column}{Which of the output columns to append to log, if append = T. Default column depends on chosen level.}

\item{units}{Time units to be used}

\item{sort}{Sort by decreasing idle time. Defaults to true. Only relevant voor trace and resource level.}

\item{...}{Deprecated arguments}
}
\description{
Calculates the amount of time that no activity occurs.
}
\details{
\itemize{

\item  On the level of the complete event log, the
  idle time metric provides an overview of summary statistics of the idle
  time per case, aggregated over the complete event log.
\item  The metric applied on the level of the specific
 cases in the event log provides an overview of the total idle time per case

\item On the level of the different traces that occur in the event log,
 the idle time metric provides an overview of the summary statistics
 of the idle time for each trace in the event log.

\item The metric can also be of interest on the level of the resources,
 to get an insight in the amount of time each resource \"wastes\" during the process.
