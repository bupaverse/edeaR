filter_activity(eventlog, activities, reverse = FALSE, ...)

ifilter_activity(eventlog)

\method{filter_activity}{activitylog}(eventlog, activities, reverse = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{eventlog}{The dataset to be used. Should be a (grouped) eventlog object.}

\item{activities}{Character vector containing one or more activity identifiers.}

\item{reverse}{Logical, indicating whether the selection should be reversed.}

\item{...}{Deprecated arguments.}
}
\value{
When given an eventlog, it will return a filtered eventlog. When given a grouped eventlog, the filter will be applied
in a stratified way (i.e. each separately for each group). The returned eventlog will be grouped on the same variables as
the original event log.
}
