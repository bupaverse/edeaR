#' Metric: Resource Involvement
#'
#' Calculates for each resource/resource-activity in what percentage of cases it is present.
#'
#
#'Next to the resource frequency, the involvement of resources in cases can be of interest to, e.g., decide how "indispensable"
#' they are. This metric is provided on three levels of analysis, which are the cases,
#' the resources, and the resource-activity combinations
#'
#' \itemize{
#'
#' \item At the level of the specific
#' cases, the absolute and relative number of distinct resources executing activities
#' in each case is calculated. This way a company gets an overview of which
#' cases are handled by a small amount of resources and which cases need more
#' resources, indicating a higher level of variance in the process.
#'
#' \item On the level of the distinct resources,
#' this metric provides the absolute and relative number of cases in which each
#' resource is involved, indicating which resources are more "necessary" within the
#' business process than the others.
#'
#' \item On the level of the specific
#' resource-activity combinations, this metric provides a list of all resource-activity
#' combinations with the absolute and relative number of cases in which each resource-activity combination is involved.
#'
#'
#' }
#'
#' @param level Level of granularity for the analysis: log,  case, activity, resource or resource-activity.
