#' Metric:  Number of repetitions
#'
#' Provides information statistics on the number of repetitions
#'
#'
#' A repetition is an execution
#' of an activity within a case while that activity has already been executed before, but
#' one or more other activities are executed in between.Similar to the self-loop metric, a distinction
#' should be made between repeat and redo repetitions.
#' Repeat repetitions are activity executions of the same activity type that are executed
#' not immediately following each other, but by the same resource. Redo repetitions
#' are activity executions of the same activity type that are executed not immediately
#' following each other and by a different resource than the first activity occurrence of
#' this activity type.
#'
#'
#' \itemize{
#'
#' \item The number of repetitions can be calculated on the level of the complete event log. This metric shows the
#' summary statistics of the number of repetitions within a case, which can provide
#' insights in the amount of waste in an event log. Each combination of two or more
#' occurrences of the same activity, executed not immediately following each other,
#' by the same resource is counted as one repeat repetition of this activity.
#'
#' \item On case level, this metric provides the absolute and relative number of repetitions in each case.
#'
#' \item On the level of specific activities, this metric shows which activities occur the most in a repetition.
#' The absolute and relative number of both repeat and redo repetitions is
#' provided by this metric, giving an overview per activity.
#'
#' \item When looking at the different resources executing activities in the event log, it can be interesting to have an overview
#' of which resources need more than one time to execute an activity in a case or
#' which resources need to have an activity redone later on in the case by another
#' resource. This metric provides the absolute and relative number of times each
#' resource appears in a repetition.
#'
#' \item Finally, the same metric can be
#' looked at on the level of specific resource-activity combinations, providing the
#'  company with specific information about which activities and which resources
#'  are involved in the repetitions. For this metric the absolute and relative number
#'   of repeat and redo repetitions is provided. Again two difierent relative numbers
#'   are provided, one relative to the total number of executions of the activity in the
#'   complete event log, and one relative to the total number of executions performed
#'   by the resource throughout the complete event log.
