#'  Metric: Processing time
#'
#'  Provides summary statistics about the processing time of the process.
#'
#'  In contrast to the throughput time of the cases in an event log, the metrics concerning
#'  the active time or the actual processing time provide summary statistics on the
#'  processing time of events on the level of the complete event log, the specific cases,
#'   traces, the activities, and the resource-activity combinations.
#'
#'   \itemize{
#'   \item On log level, this metric calculates the summary statistics of the actual processing time per case,
#'   summarised over the complete event log.
#'   \item On case level, a list of cases with their processing time are provided.
#'   \item On trace level, the summary statistics of processing time
#'   can be calculated for each possible sequence of activities that
#'   appears in the event log.
#'   \item Duration can also be calculated on the level
#'   of each activity. For each activity, an overview of the average processing time
#'   -or the service time- of this activity can be of interest.
#'   \item We can also look at the processing time per resource.
#'   \item On the resource-activity level, finally,
#'   we can have a look at the efficiency of resources by looking at the combination
#'   of each resource with each activity.
#'   }

#' @param level Level of granularity for the analysis: log,  case, trace, activity, resource or resource-activity.
#' For more information, see \code{vignette("metrics", "edeaR")}
#'
#' @param sort Sort on decreasing processing time. For case level only.
#' @param work_schedule A schedule of working hours. If provided, only working hours are counted as processing time.
