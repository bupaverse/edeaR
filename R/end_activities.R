#' Metric: End activities
#'
#' Analyse the end activities in the process.
#'
#' \itemize{
#' \item On log levels, this metric shows the absolute and relative number of activities that are the last activity in one or more of the cases.
#' \item On the level of the specific cases, this metric provides an overview of the end activity of each case.
#' \item  On the activity level This metric calculates for each activity the absolute and relative number of cases that end with this activity type.
#'Similar to the start activities metric, the relative number is calculated as a portion of the
#'number of cases, being the number of \"opportunities\" that an activity could be the end activity.
#'The cumulative sum is added to have an insight in the number of activities that is required to cover a certain part of the total.
#' \item On the level of the distinct resources, an overview of which resources execute the last activity per case can be of interest for a
#'company. Probably this person is responsible for the correct communication to the customer.
#'\item  Finally, on the resource-activity level,
#'this metric shows for each occurring resource-activity combination the absolute and relative number of times this resource executes this
#'activity as an end activity in a case.}

#' @param level Level of granularity for the analysis: log,  case, activity, resource or resource-activity.
