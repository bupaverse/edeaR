#' Filter: Life cycle Presence
#'
#' Filters activity instances based on the presence (or absence) of life cycles
#'
#' This functions allows to filter activity instances that (do not) contain certain life cycle identifiers.
#' It requires as input a vector containing one or more life cycle labels and it has a method
#' argument. The latter can have the values all, none or one_of.
#' \itemize{
#' \item When set to `all`, it means
#' that all the specified life cycle labels must be present for an activity instance to be selected
#' \item `none` means that they are not allowed to be present.
#' \item `one_of` means that at least one of them must be present.
#' \item `only` means that only (a set of) these life cycle labels are allowed to be present
#' \item `exact` means that only exactly these life cycle labels can be present (although multiple times and in random orderings)
#' }

#' @param method Filter method. If "all", each of the life cycle labels should be present. If "one_of", at least one of them should be present. If "none", none of the life cycle labels are allowed to occur in the filtered activity instances.
#' @param lifecycle Character vector containing one or more life cycle identifiers.
