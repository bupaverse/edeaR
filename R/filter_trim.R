#' Filter: Trim cases
#'
#' Trim cases from the first event of a set of start activities to the last event of a set of end activities.
#'
#' One can trim cases by removing one or more activity instances
#' at the start and/or end of a case. Trimming is performed until all cases have a start and/or
#' end point belonging to a set of allowed activity labels. This filter requires a set of allowed
#' start activities and/or a set of allowed end activities. If one of them is not provided it will
#' not trim the cases at this edge.The selection can be reversed, which means that
#' only the trimmed events at the start and end of cases are retained. As such, this argument
#' allows to cut intermediate parts out of traces.
