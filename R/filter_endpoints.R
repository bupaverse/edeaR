#' Filter: Start and end activities
#'
#' Filters the log based on a provided set of start and end activities
#'
#'The filter_endpoints method filters cases based on the first and last activity label. It can be used in two ways: by specifying vectors with allowed start
#'activities and/or allowed end activities, or by specifying a percentile. In the latter case, the percentile value will be used as a cut off.
#'For example, when set to 0.9, it will select the most common endpoint pairs which together cover at least 90% of the cases, and filter the event log accordingly.
#'
#'
#' @param start_activities A vector of activity identifiers, or NULL
#'
#' @param end_activities A vector of activity identifiers, or NULL
#'
#' @param percentage A percentage p to be used as percentile cut off. When this is used, the most common endpoint-pairs will be selected until at least
#' the p\% of the cases are selected.
